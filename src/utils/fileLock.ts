 * exposes per-entry writes to clobbering between concurrent processes, since
 * the seqlock added in v1.10.x only protects readers from torn states, not
 * writers from racing each other.
 *
 * **Test escape hatch: `CODEX_DISABLE_LOCKING=1`.** Set this env var to fall
 * back to running the closure unlocked when lock acquisition fails. This
 * preserves the pre-v1.11 silent-fallback behavior for tests that intentionally
 * exercise contended-lock scenarios. The env var is read fresh on every call,
 * so tests can flip it on and off without restarting the process.
 *
 * Production code should never set `CODEX_DISABLE_LOCKING`. There are no
 * known production environments where lock acquisition is expected to fail.
