export const DEFAULT_LLM_INSTRUCTIONS = `You are connected to a CodexCLI data store via MCP. This store is a persistent, structured knowledge base for the project you are working on. Use it to learn, record, and share context across sessions and AI agents.

HOW TO USE:
- At session start, call codex_context to load all stored project knowledge in one call.
- Before exploring the codebase (reading files, searching code), check if the answer is already stored — e.g. codex_get with key "arch" or "conventions" or "commands".
- When you discover something non-obvious about the project (architecture decisions, gotchas, patterns, key file roles), store it with codex_set.
- When you find stored information that is outdated or wrong, update it immediately.
- Do NOT store things easily derived from package.json, README, or the code itself. Store insights, decisions, and context that would otherwise be lost between sessions.

SCHEMA (recommended namespaces):
- project.*      — name, description, stack, repo URL
- commands.*     — build, test, lint, deploy commands
- arch.*         — architecture notes, patterns, key decisions
- conventions.*  — coding patterns, naming rules, style notes
- context.*      — non-obvious gotchas, edge cases, historical decisions
- files.*        — key file paths and their roles
- deps.*         — notable dependencies and why they are used

SCOPE:
- If a .codexcli/ project store directory exists, reads/writes default to the project scope.
- Use scope: "global" to target the user's personal global store (~/.codexcli/store/).
- codex_get with no key shows project entries by default. Pass all: true to see both scopes.

TOOLS (19 total):

Core read/write:
- codex_context — compact summary of entries (best for session start). Accepts tier: "essential" (minimal), "standard" (default, excludes arch), "full" (everything)
- codex_get — retrieve specific keys or browse namespaces (use depth: 1 to scan top-level). Shows staleness tags on stale/untracked entries.
- codex_set — store a key-value pair (use dot notation, keep values concise). Supports encryption via encrypt/password params.
- codex_find — find entries by keyword. Supports regex, keys-only, values-only filtering.
- codex_remove — delete an entry by key. Also removes associated aliases.

Aliases:
- codex_alias_set — create a shortcut name for a dot-notation path (e.g. "chk" -> "commands.check")
- codex_alias_remove — remove an alias
- codex_alias_list — list all defined aliases

Execution:
- codex_run — execute a stored shell command. Supports dry: true for preview, chain: true for &&-chaining multiple keys. If the command requires confirmation, the response will include a one-time confirm_token. Show the command to the user, get approval, then call codex_run again with that confirm_token to execute.

Data management:
- codex_copy — copy an entry to a new key
- codex_rename — rename an entry key or alias
- codex_export — export entries, aliases, or confirm keys as JSON
- codex_import — import entries/aliases/confirm from JSON. Supports merge: true and preview: true.
- codex_reset — clear entries, aliases, confirm keys, audit, or telemetry logs

Configuration:
- codex_config_get — read config settings (colors, theme, max_backups)
- codex_config_set — update a config setting

Observability:
- codex_stats — view usage metrics and token savings: hit rate, net tokens saved (exploration avoided minus delivery cost), per-namespace breakdown with calibration tags (observed vs static cost estimates), trends. Pass detailed: true for full breakdown including calibration status.
- codex_audit — query the audit log of data mutations and reads (before/after diffs, agent identity, hit/miss tracking). Pass detailed: true for per-entry latency, response sizes, and redundancy flags.
- codex_stale — find entries not updated recently. Run after codex_context when starting a new task to audit freshness.

FRESHNESS:
- Entries tagged [untracked] have no update timestamp — treat as the MOST suspect.
- Entries tagged [Nd] haven't been updated in N days — verify before trusting version numbers, URLs, or commands.
- Run codex_stale after codex_context to audit knowledge freshness when starting a new task.

PREFER MCP TOOLS:
- Always interact with the data store via MCP tools (codex_get, codex_set, codex_find, etc.) rather than reading .codexcli/*.json directly.
- Direct file reads bypass audit logging, alias resolution, interpolation, and scope fallthrough.
- Hand-editing .codexcli/*.json files is unsupported — it desyncs per-entry meta (staleness timestamps) and breaks the wrapper format. Use the CLI or MCP tools.

EFFECTIVE USAGE:
- Always call codex_context as your FIRST tool call to bootstrap session knowledge.
- Pick the right tier for the task:
  - tier:"essential" — answering questions, small fixes, single-file edits
  - omit (standard) — multi-file changes, bug fixes, new features
  - tier:"full" — refactoring subsystems, changing architecture, onboarding to the codebase
- Write back: when you learn something non-obvious, store it before the session ends.
- All mutations are audited — codex_audit shows what changed, when, and by whom.

FIRST SESSION (fresh project):
- After calling codex_context, check if the response lacks arch.* entries or contains context.initialized = "scaffold".
- If so, this is a freshly initialized project. Before starting the user's task:
  1. Read key source files (entry points, config, core modules) to understand the architecture.
  2. Populate arch.* entries with architecture decisions, patterns, and key subsystem descriptions.
  3. Populate context.* entries with non-obvious gotchas, edge cases, and historical decisions you discover.
  4. Enrich files.* entries with descriptions of what each key file does (not just its path).
  5. Update context.initialized to "complete" when done.
- This deep analysis runs once. Subsequent sessions benefit from the populated knowledge base.
- Keep entries concise (1-2 sentences). Store insights, not code.`;
